This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of mobile-based cognitive training exercises on COVID-19 related distress and maladaptive cognitions.Methods: Following initial screening (n = 924), participants scoring 1 standard deviations above the mean of the COVID-19 Distress Scale were randomized into two groups. Participants in the immediate-app group (iApp; n = 25) started using the application at baseline (T0) for 12 days (from T0 to T1). Participants in the delayed-app group (dApp; n = 22) started using the mobile application at T1 (crossover) and used it for the following 12 days (T1 to T2).Results: Intention to treat analyses indicated that the iApp group exhibited lower COVID-19 distress, lower depression, fewer intolerance of uncertainty and obsessive beliefs than the dApp group at T1. In addition, using the app for 12 consecutive days was associated with large effect-size reductions (Cohen's d ranging from 0.81 to 2.35) in COVID-19 distress and related maladaptive cognitions in the iApp group (from T0 to T1) and the dApp group (from T1 to T2). Moreover, these reductions were maintained at the follow-up. Limitations: This study was a crossover trial with a relatively limited sample size and mainly female participants. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the usefulness of brief, low-intensity, portable interventions in alleviating the negative effects of the pandemic on mental health.

This similarity causes misdiagnosis of PNES and epilepsy patients, thus patients suffering from PNES may be treated with antiepileptic drugs which can have various side effects. Furthermore, seizure is diagnosed after time consuming examination of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings realized by the expert. In this study, automated temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patient, PNES patient and healthy subject discrimination method from EEG signals is proposed in order to eliminate the misdiagnosis and long inspection time of EEG recordings. Also, this study provides automated approach for TLE interictal and ictal epoch classification, and TLE, PNES and healthy epoch classification. For this purpose, subbands of EEG signals are determined from discrete wavelet transform (DWT), then classification is performed using ensemble classifiers fed with energy feature extracted from the subbands. Experiments are conducted by trying two approaches for TLE, PNES and healthy epoch classification and patient discrimination. Results show that in the TLE, PNES and healthy epoch classification the highest accuracy of 97.2%, sensitivity of 97.9% and specificity of 98.1% were achieved by applying adaptive boosting method, and the highest accuracy of 87.1%, sensitivity of 86.0% and specificity of 93.6% were attained using random under sampling (RUS) boosting method in the TLE patient, PNES patients and the healthy subject discrimination.

Schemas, which are the basic structures of cognition, are understudied. This study examined the effects of sex on early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) and the clinical characteristics of migraine in adolescents with migraine.Methods: The sample comprised 171 adolescents (67.3% females, n = 115) aged 12-18 years. The clinical characteristics of migraine (duration, severity, frequency of headaches, etc.), accompanying symptoms (nausea, vomiting, photophobia, etc.) and EMSs were evaluated depending on sex. Psychopathology and abuse history were analyzed as covariates in this study.Results: The mean age was 15.4 +/- 1.9 among the females and 15.2 +/- 2.0 among the males (p = 0.65). There was no difference in terms of migraine characteristics, and except for dizziness and pain relief by massage, all other symptoms were similar between the sexes. Female adolescent migraineurs significantly elevated scores for EMS of emotional deprivation, abandonment/instability, defectiveness/shame (disconnection/rejection domain), dependence/incompetence, vulnerability to harm/illness, failure (in impaired autonomy/performance domain) and negativity/pessimism (in hypervigilance/inhibition domain). On the other hand, male migraineurs had significantly elevated scores only in insufficient self-control/self-discipline (in impaired limits domain). Type of migraine and current psychopathology had no significant effect on the EMS domains, while sexual abuse history significantly affected some EMS.Conclusion: Our study highlights the importance of screening for EMSs among adolescent patients with migraine. Schema therapy and similar therapeutic interventions may be used in the management of migraine in adolescents. Gender may also be important (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

These compounds were obtained by the one-pot microwave-assisted method via a modified Hantzsch reaction. The photophysical characterization showed in organic solutions absorption maxima in the UV region, ascribed to spin and symmetry allowed electronic transitions( 1)pi-pi*. In addition, they presented a main fluorescence emission in the violet-blue regions (406-445 nm), with a relatively large Stokes shift (54-81 nm), depending on the structure of the compounds. BSA fluorescence quenching experiments based on the intrinsic fluorescence of the Trp residues were successfully applied to these compounds, indicating strong interaction with BSA by a static mechanism. The docking simulations corroborated the strong interaction between the studied compounds and BSA, where the surroundings of Trp213 seemed to be the preferred interaction site for all compounds and were responsible for the fluorescence quenching effects.

As a result, nowadays translation items are not commonly used for measuring language proficiency in international language proficiency tests (e. g. TOEFL, IELTS). However, there are several countries that still use translation items in their national language proficiency tests (e. g. Turkey, Japan, China, Romania among others). The present study aims to examine whether or not multiple-choice translation items are an appropriate tool for measuring proficiency in English. To this end, the perceived level of difficulty and validity of multiple-choice translation items in the National English Proficiency Test (YDS) in Turkey were examined. The findings revealed that the participants did significantly better on the translation items than on the rest of the test items. They also perceived the translation items as the easiest among all the rest items in YDS. Moreover, while YDS as a whole indicated a strong validity based on correlation with TOEFL PBT Reading Sample Test, the translation items indicated moderate validity. Importantly, there was a significant difference between the two correlations. These findings suggest that multiple-choice translation items are likely to lower the overall validity of YDS tests, inflate the scores of test-takers and, thus, might be considered as problematic for the quality of the tests.

Treatment is commonly monitored by measuring 17-OH progesterone (17OHP) and androstenedione (D4). Design Retrospective cohort study using real-world data to evaluate 17OHP and D4 in relation to hydrocortisone (HC) dose in CAH patients treated in 14 countries. Patients Pseudonymized data from children with 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21OHD) recorded in the International CAH Registry. Measurements Assessments between January 2000 and October 2020 in patients prescribed HC were reviewed to summarise biomarkers 17OHP and D4 and HC dose. Longitudinal assessment of measures was carried out using linear mixed-effects models (LMEM). Results Cohort of 345 patients, 52.2% female, median age 4.3 years (interquartile range: 3.1-9.2) were taking a median 11.3 mg/m(2)/day (8.6-14.4) of HC. Median 17OHP was 35.7 nmol/l (3.0-104.0). Median D4 under 12 years was 0 nmol/L (0-2.0) and above 12 years was 10.5 nmol/L (3.9-21.0). There were significant differences in biomarker values between centres (p < 0.05). Correlation between D4 and 17OHP was good in multiple regression with age (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.29). In longitudinal assessment, 17OHP levels did not change with age, whereas D4 levels increased with age (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.08). Neither biomarker varied directly with dose or weight (p > 0.05). Multivariate LMEM showed HC dose decreasing by 1.0 mg/m(2)/day for every 1 point increase in weight standard deviation score. Discussion Registry data show large variability in 17OHP and D4 between centres. 17OHP correlates with D4 well when accounting for age. Prescribed HC dose per body surface area decreased with weight gain.

Despite novel treatments, patients with ARDs still experience a reduced life expectancy, partly caused by the higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This includes CV inflammation, rhythm disturbances, perfusion abnormalities (ischaemia/infarction), dysregulation of vasoreactivity, myocardial fibrosis, coagulation abnormalities, pulmonary hypertension, valvular disease, and side-effects of immunomodulatory therapy. Currently, the evaluation of CV involvement in patients with ARDs is based on the assessment of cardiac symptoms, coupled with electrocardiography, blood testing, and echocardiography. However, CVD may not become overt until late in the course of the disease, thus potentially limiting the therapeutic window for intervention. More recently, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has allowed for the early identification of pathophysiologic structural/functional alterations that take place before the onset of clinically overt CVD. CMR allows for detailed evaluation of biventricular function together with tissue characterization of vessels/myocardium in the same examination, yielding a reliable assessment of disease activity that might not be mirrored by blood biomarkers and other imaging modalities. Therefore, CMR provides diagnostic information that enables timely clinical decision-making and facilitates the tailoring of treatment to individual patients. Here we review the role of CMR in the early and accurate diagnosis of CVD in patients with ARDs compared with other non-invasive imaging modalities. Furthermore, we present a consensus-based decision algorithm for when a CMR study could be considered in patients with ARDs, together with a standardized study protocol. Lastly, we discuss the clinical implications of findings from a CMR examination.

Some studies have shown that the ratios between maximum velocities and anterior-posterior diameters of hilar and aortomesenteric segments of the left kidney vein between upright and supine positions must be more than 4 in order to make a Nutcracker syndrome diagnosis. Our aim was to investigate whether the use of a decrease in aortomesenteric angle between upright and supine positions in the presence of isolated orthostatic proteinuria can be a criterion for the diagnosis of Nutcracker syndrome. Relevant patient information, which included demographic data, clinical examination findings, laboratory data, urinary system ultrasound, and kidney color flow Doppler ultrasound results, were prospectively collected. Thirty-nine pediatric patients with orthostatic proteinuria were included in the study. Left kidney vein compression findings were demonstrated in 31 patients. The ratio of maximum velocities of hilar and aortomesenteric segments of the left kidney vein between upright and supine positions was above 4 in only 7 of our patients. Ratio of aortomesenteric angle between upright and supine positions was significantly decreased for patients with left kidney vein compression findings. Conclusion: The use of a decrease in the ratio of aortomesenteric angle between upright and supine positions in the presence of orthostatic proteinuria, instead of the ratios for maximum velocities and anterior-posterior diameters of hilar and aortomesenteric segments, can be more helpful for the diagnosis of Nutcracker syndrome in the differential diagnosis of orthostatic proteinuria.

The objective of this study was to develop a novel formula for the estimation of urine osmolality using an AutoML tool and to determine the efficiency of AutoML tools in a clinical laboratory setting. Methods Three hundred routine urinalysis samples were used for reference osmolality and urine clinical chemistry analysis. The H2O AutoML engine completed the machine learning development steps with minimum human intervention. Four feature groups were created, which include different urinalysis measurements according to the Boruta feature selection algorithm. Method comparison statistics including Spearman correlation, Passing-Bablok regression analysis were performed, and Bland Altman plots were created to compare model predictions with the reference method. The minimum allowable bias (24.17%) from biological variation data was used as the limit of agreement. Results The AutoML engine developed a total of 183 ML models. Conductivity and specific gravity had the highest variable importance. Models that include conductivity, specific gravity, and other urinalysis parameters had the highest R-2 (0.70-0.83), and 70-84% of results were within the limit of agreement. Conclusions Combining urinary conductivity with other urinalysis parameters using validated machine learning models can yield a promising surrogate. Additionally, AutoML tools facilitate the machine learning development cycle and should be considered for developing ML models in clinical laboratories.

Methods: Thirty patients who developed adhesive capsulitis due to lymphedema were divided into two groups as study (n = 15) and control (n = 15) groups. Both groups received 20 minutes of exercise five days a week for three weeks using a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer, as well as a hot pack and TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) treatment to the shoulder joint. The study group received 45 minutes of intensive decongestive therapy along with the adhesive capsulitis treatment. The visual analogue scale was used to assess pain, circumference, and volumetric measurements were used to assess edema, and the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Problems Questionnaire (DASH: Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) was used to assess upper extremity functionality. The shoulder range of motion was evaluated. Results: Both groups had improvements in pain (P < 0.001), shoulder joint range of motion (P < 0.001), and upper extremity functionality (P < 0.001) after the treatment. There was a significant decrease in circumference and volumetric measurements in the study group (P < 0.001). However, no differences were seen in measurements in the control group. Conclusions: The results showed that complex decongestive therapy was beneficial in reducing lymphedema in breast cancer patients who acquired adhesive capsulitis due to lymphedema. Consequently, the authors believe that supplementing conventional physiotherapy with complex decongestive therapy will benefit patients.

Materials and method: Patients with ARDS and placed in PP for 3 times (PP1, PP2, PP3) consecutively were included. Arterial blood gases (ABG), partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO(2)) ratios, partial pressure of carbondioxide (PaCO2), PEEP, and FiO(2) were recorded before (bPP), during (dPP), and after (aPP) every prone positioning. Eye, skin, nerve, and tube complications related to PP were collected. Results: In all positions, PaO2 value during PP was significantly higher than PaO2 before and after prone position (p = 0.001). PaO2 values were similar in all (PP1, PP2, PP3) bPP arterial blood gases. We found difference in PaO2 values during prone position between the first (PP1) and second proning (PP2). When each prone was evaluated within itself, PaO2/FiO(2) increases after proning compared to before proning. PaO2/FiO(2) during PP were higher compared to before proning ones. PaO2/FiO(2) during PP1 was significantly higher compared to during PP3 (p = 0.005). In PP3, PEEP values bPP, dPP, and aPP were significantly higher than PEEP values after the second prone (p = 0.02, p = 0.001, p = 0.01). In the third prone, PaCO2 levels were higher than in PP1 and PP2. There were eye complications in 13, tube-related complications in 10, skin complications in 30, and nerve damage in 1 patient. Conclusion: We believe that a more careful decision should be made after the second prone position in patients who have to be placed in sequential prone position.

The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems constitute the adaptive immune system in prokaryotes that provide resistance against invasive genetic elements. The genus Propionibacterium comprises gram-positive, facultative anaerobe, non-spore-forming bacteria, and is the source of some B group vitamins such as B12 as well as bacteriocins. Some of the selected species of the genus Propionibacterium spp. were reclassified into the three genera in 2016 (Acidipropionibacterium spp., Pseudopropionibacterium spp., Cutibacterium spp.). Therefore, this study compared CRISPR/Cas systems, Cas 1 and repeat sequences phylogeny, phage/plasmid surveys as well as insertion sequences of new genera members. In this study, a total of 34 genomes of 13 species were observed with a bioinformatic approach. CRISPR-Cas + + and CRISPRDetect were used to detect CRISPR/Cas systems, direct repeats, and spacers. 39 CRISPR-Cas systems were detected. Type I-E, Type I-U, and one incomplete III-B CRISPR-Cas subtypes were identified. Most of the strains had Cas1/Cas4 fusion proteins. Pseudopropionibacterium propionicum strains had two types I-U and one of the CRISPR loci had csx17 cas genes. Common phage invaders were Propionibacterium phage E6, G4, E1, Anatole, and Doucette. The BLSM62 similarity score of all Cas1 sequences was 48.4% while the pairwise identity of repeat sequences was 48.7%. Common insertion sequences were ISL3, IS3, IS30. The diversity analysis of the CRISPR/Cas system in the genus Propionibacterium provided a new perspective for determining the role of the CRISPR-Cas system in the evolution of new genera.

Methods: The cases of 230 patients who had undergone PMCDT to treat IFDVT from January 2017 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The preoperative, operative, and postoperative variables, Marder scores, outcomes, and follow-up assessments with the Villalta score and venous clinical severity score were investigated. Results: Anatomic success was achieved for 95.2% of the 230 patients. The mean Marder score had decreased from 12.65 +/- 2.1 to 2.4 +/- 1.3 postoperatively (P < .01). Early recurrent thrombosis had developed in 13 patients (5.65%). The primary patency at the 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up visits was 94.0%, 87.2%, and 81.7%, respectively. From 1 to 6 months, the Villalta score had decreased from 8.32 +/- 4.14 to 3.43 +/- 0.61 and the venous clinical severity score had decreased from 4.0 +/- 1.8 to 1.82 +/- 0.36 (P < .05). No statistically significant difference was found in the PTS severity scores at 12 months of follow-up compared with at 6 months. The mean change in the venous disease-specific quality of life from baseline to 12 months was 29.41 +/- 1.99 (P = .029). The total recurrence rate was 19.63% at 1 year. Conclusions: For a select group of patients with acute IFDVT, the use of PMCDT and postoperative anticoagulation therapy offered significant reductions in clot burden, leg pain, and swelling, achieving a significant reduction in PTS severity scores at 6 months.

CD47 is an antiphagocytic molecule aiding tumor resistance against host immune surveillance. The relationship between CD47 expression and TAM-related microenvironment in endometrial carcinoma (EC) is poorly understood. The expression and prognostic significance of CD47 and CD163-labeled TAMs in 165 EC cases was assessed with CD47 and CD163 immunohistochemical studies. CD47 expression was found in 156/165 (94.6%) cases. CD47 expression was significantly higher in nonendometrioid carcinomas. CD47 overexpression was associated with histologic grade. High epithelial and stromal TAMs counts were also associated with high tumoral CD47 expression. High epithelial, stromal, and margin TAMs counts were associated with higher histologic grade and lymphovascular invasion. Epithelial TAMs counts were higher in patients with nonendometrioid carcinomas (P=0.0001) and cases with recurrence (P=0.018). High stromal TAMs counts were associated with deeper myometrial invasion (P=0.017) and the presence of distant metastasis (P=0.024). The counts of margin TAMs was significantly correlated with the depth of myometrial invasion, lymphovascular invasion, FIGO stage, lymph node metastases, distant metastasis, and recurrence (P=0.0001, 0.0001, 0.004, 0.005, 0.014, and 0.04, respectively). CD47 expression was not associated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival. However, high epithelial and stromal TAM counts were associated with shorter OS. Besides, high epithelial and margin TAM counts were associated with shorter progression-free survival.
